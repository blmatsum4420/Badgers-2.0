# Sweater Weather
## Badgers-2.0: Collin Chee, Matthew Martel, Brandon Matsumoto, Jacob Saunders

## Project Overview
This project utilizes historical weather data in Yolo County dating all the way to 1980 to predict future weather conditions for the next 30 years. The vizualizations are then connected to a website where users can choose different climate measurements and vizualize historical and future data. The main machine learning model used to predict future trends is Facebook's time-series prophet model. 

Yolo County policy makers and outdoor workers should consider the future predictions to adjust for the changes in climate and how it affects Davis residents.

## Project Files
